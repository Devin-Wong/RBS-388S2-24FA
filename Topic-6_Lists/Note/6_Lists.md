In previous topics, we have discussed basics of lists:
- How to define a list
- How to access the elements in a list
- How to update the elements
- `range()` function gives us a range of numbers
- `len()` function to obtain length
In this part, we will study more about list, which is a useful and powerful container in Python .
## 1. A list is a sequence

### Define a list
- Like a string, a **list** is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, the values can be any type. For example,
	```python
	>>> list_1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]
	>>> list_2 = ['Rutgers', 'Princeton', 'NYU']
	```
- In `list_1`, all values are number, or specifically `int`. In `list_2` all values are strings. 
- However, the elements in a list **are not necessarily the same type**. For example,
	```python
	>>> list_3 = [1, 3.14, 'Rutgers']
	```
- In the above list, we have `int`, `float`, and `string`
- We can even put a list into another list.
	```python
	>>> list_4 = [[1, 3.14], 'Rutgers']
	```
- In the above list, the first element is a list, which is `[1, 3.14]`; the second list is a string.
- So you can image that we can use a list to represent a matrix.
	```python
	>>> m = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
	```

### `len()` function
- Just like strings, `len()` also works for lists. 
	```python
	>>> list_1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]
	>>> len(list_1)
	4
	```
### List slices
- List strings, the indices in list starts at 0.
	```python
	>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	>>> l[1:3]
	['b', 'c']
	```
- `l[1:3]` returns the elements with indices 1 and 2. It means it starts from 1 and stops at the index smaller than 3.
- If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning.
	```python
	>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	>>> l[:4]
	['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
	```
- If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end.
	```python
	>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	>>> l[3:]
	['d', 'e', 'f']
	```
- If you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.
	```python
	>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	>>> l[:]
	['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	```

## 2. Lists are mutable
- Different from strings, lists are mutable.
	```python
	>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	>>> l[0] = 'w'
	>>> l
	['w', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	```
- We can also use slices to change the elements in a list.
	```python
	>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	>>> l[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
	>>> l
	['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	```

## 3. List methods

### `.append()`
- `append()` method adds a new element to the end of a list.
	```python
	>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c']
	>>> l.append('d')
	>>> l
	['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
	```

### `.extend()`
- `.extend()` takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:
	```python
	>>> l1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
	>>> l2 = ['d', 'e']
	>>> l1.extend(l2)
	>>> l1
	['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
	```

### `.sort()`
- `.sort()` sorts the list ascending by default. 
- There is an optional parameter, `reverse`, in `sort` method. Default is `reverse=False`. `reverse=True` will sort the list descending. 
- For strings:
	```python
	>>> l = ['d', 'b', 'a', 'c']
	>>> l.sort()
	>>> l
	['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
	```
- For numbers:
	```python
	>>> l = [4, 10, 5, 2]
	>>> l.sort()
	>>> l
	[2, 4, 5, 10]
	```
- or
	```python
	>>> l = [4, 10, 5, 2]
	>>> l.sort(reverse=True)
	>>> l
	[10, 5, 4, 2]
	```


## 4. Void and fruitful method/function 
- Let us review methods in strings. Take `.upper()` for an example,
	```python
	name = 'jin'
	name = name.upper()
	print(name)
	```
- We will get the expected result, `JIN`. 
- Let us compare the string methods with the list methods below. Take the string `.append()` for an example,
	```python
	l = ['a', 'b', 'c']
	l.append('d')
	print(l)
	```
- Can you see the difference?
- **In string**, the method `.upper()` return a string, which is capitalized letters. 
- We call a function/method that returns values **fruitful function/method**, called a function that doesn't return values **void function/method**.
- **In list**, most methods are *void*; they modify the list and return None.
## 5. Traversing a list
- The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:
	```python
	universities = ['Rutgers', 'NYU', 'Princeton']
	for i in universities:
		print(i)
	```
- We can also traverse a list through indices.
	```python
	universities = ['Rutgers', 'NYU', 'Princeton']
	for i in range(len(universities)):
		print(names[i])
	```

## 6. List operations
### `+` operator
- The + operator concatenates lists:
	```python
	>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
	>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
	>>> c = a + b
	>>> c
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	```
### `*` operator
- The * operator repeats a list a given number of times:
	```python
	>>> [0] * 4
	[0, 0, 0, 0]
	>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3
	[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
	```
### `in` operator
- The `in` operator helps find out whether an element is in a list.
	```python
	>>> universities = ['Rutgers', 'NYU', 'Princeton']
	>>> 'Rutgers' in universities
	True
	>>> 'Harvard' in universities
	False
	```

## 7. Deleting elements

**Method 1: `.pop()`** 
- If you know the index of the element you want, you can use pop:
	```python
	>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
	>>> x = t.pop(1)
	>>> t
	['a', 'c']
	>>> x
	'b'
	```
- `pop` modifies the list and returns the element that was removed.

**Method 2: `del`**
- If you don’t need the removed value, you can use the `del` operator:
	```python
	>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
	>>> del t[1]
	>>> t
	['a', 'c']
	```
- To remove more than one element, you can use `del` with a slice index:
	```python
	>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
	>>> del t[1:5]
	>>> t
	['a', 'f']
	```

**Method 3: `.remove()`**
- If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use remove:
	```python
	>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
	>>> t.remove('b')
	>>> t
	['a', 'c']
	```
- The return value from remove is None.

## 8. List operation 1: Map

### Map
- Sometimes you want to traverse one list while building another. For example, the following function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of square values.
	```python
	def square_values(x):
		squared = []
		for n in x:
			squared.append(n ** 2)
		return squared    

	numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	print(square_values(numbers))
	```
- An operation like *square* is sometimes called a **map** because it “maps” a function (in this case the function square) onto each of the elements in a sequence.
- We can achieve the same result without using an explicit loop by using `map()`.
	```python
	def square(x)
		return number ** 2

	numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

	squared = map(square, numbers)

	print(list(squared))
	```
- The call to `map()` applies `square()` to all the values in `numbers` and returns an iterator that yields square values. Then we call `list()` on `map()` to create a list object containing the square values.
- Since `map()` is written in C and is highly optimized, its internal implied loop can be more efficient than a regular Python `for` loop. This is one advantage of using `map()`.

- Format of `map()`
	```python
	map(function, iterable)
	```

### Lambda function
- Functions can (1) perform action(s), or/and (2) return output(s)
- Lambda function is mainly used to take inputs and return outputs.
	```python
	def divide(x, y):
		return x/y

	# lambda function, which is equivalent to the above divide function.
	divide = lambda x, y: x/y

	print(divide(1,3))
	```
- Which is interesting in lambda functions is that *if we don't assign lambda function to a variable, Python will destroy it immediately.*

**Lamdba function in `map()`**
- Lambda function is often used in when a function is used only once. 
- For example, in the above map program, we can use lambda function instead of defining an explicit function.
	```python
	numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

	squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)

	print(list(squared))
	```

## 9. List operation 2: Filter
- Let us create a program, which can select positive numbers from a given list.
	```python
	def select_positive(x):
		positive_numbers = []
		for i in x:
			if i>0:
				positive_numbers.append(i)
		return positive_numbers

	numbers = [0, -1, 2, -3, 4]
	print(select_positive(numbers))
	```
- An operation like `select_positive` above is called a **filter** because it selects some of the elements and filters out the others.
- We can achieve the same result without using an explicit loop by using `filter()`.
	```python
	def is_positive(n):
		return n > 0

	numbers = [0, -1, 2, -3, 4]
	positive_values = filter(is_positive, numbers)

	print(list(positive_values))
	```
- You can see the syntax is the same as `map()`. It just `filter(function, iterable)`, in which return value in the function should be boolean (True or False)
- We may use lambda function in `filter()`.
	```python
	numbers = [0, -1, 2, -3, 4]
	positive_values = filter(lambda n: n>0, numbers)

	print(list(positive_values))
	```


## 10. List comprehension
- Comprehensions help create new lists simply.
- For example, we would like to create a new list containing the values that are two times values in another list.
	```python
	numbers = [1, 3, 5]
	double_numbers = []

	for n in numbers:
		double_numbers.append(n * 2)

	print(double_numbers)
	```
- Comprehension has similar syntax above, but much shorter and easier to understand.
	```python
	numbers = [1, 3, 5]

	double_numbers = [n * 2 for n in numbers]

	print(double_numbers)
	```

**Comprehensions with conditionals**
- We can also use conditionals in comprehensions.
- For example, if we would like to print out the positive numbers in a list. We can use comprehensions with conditionals.
	```python
	numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4]
	positive_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n > 0] 
	print(positive_numbers)
	```


## 11. Practice questions

1. Find even numbers, using loop and `append()` method.
	- Method 1:
		- Define a list containing a list of numbers
		- Use `for` loop to traverse the elements in the list. If the element is an even number, put it into a new list using `append` method.
		- For example, given a list `[2, 3, 10, 17, 20]`, the  result is [2, 10, 20].
	- Method 2:
		- Use comprehension to finish the question.
2. Find prime numbers
	- Create a function which takes an integer, return `True` if the number is a prime number and return `False` otherwise.
	- Define a list containing a list of numbers
	- Use `filter` function to obtain the prime numbers in the list and print them.
		- For example, given a list `[2, 3, 10, 17, 20]`, the prime numbers are 2,  3 and 17.
3. Capitalize all words in a list, using `map` function.
	- Create a function which takes a string and returns capitalized string.
	- Define a list containing several words/strings.
	- Use `map` function to capitalize all words in the list.
	- For example, given a list `['Rbs', 'Rutgers']`,  the result is ['RBS', 'RUTGERS'].
	- Use comprehension to finish the question. 
4. Write a function called `nested_sum` that takes a list of lists of integers and adds up the elements from all of the nested lists. For example:
	```python
	>>> t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> print(nested_sum(t))
	21
	```


	```python
	d = {
		'Jack': ["Mary", "Joan", "Hellen"],
		'Mary': ["Jack", "Joan", "Peter"],
		'Jin':['Mary', 'Joan']
	}
	```
