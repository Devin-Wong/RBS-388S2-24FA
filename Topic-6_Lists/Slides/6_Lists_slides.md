# 1. A list is a sequence


---
## Define a list

```python
>>> list_1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]
>>> list_2 = ['Rutgers', 'Princeton', 'NYU']
```

---
## `len()` function
```python
>>> list_1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]
>>> len(list_1)
4
```

---

## List slices
```python
>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> l[1:3]
['b', 'c']
>>> l[:4]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> l[3:]
['d', 'e', 'f']
>>> l[:]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```


---
# 2. Lists are mutable

```python
>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> l[0] = 'w'
>>> l
['w', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

---

## 3. List methods

---


### `.append()`
- `append()` method adds a new element to the end of a list.
```python
>>> l = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> l.append('d')
>>> l
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```
---

### `.extend()`
- `.extend()` takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:
```python
>>> l1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> l2 = ['d', 'e']
>>> l1.extend(l2)
>>> l1
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```
---

### `.sort()`
- `.sort()` sorts the list ascending by default. 
- There is an optional parameter, `reverse`, in `sort` method. Default is `reverse=False`. `reverse=True` will sort the list descending. 

- For numbers:
```python
>>> l = [4, 10, 5, 2]
>>> l.sort()
>>> l
[2, 4, 5, 10]
```
- or
```python
>>> l = [4, 10, 5, 2]
>>> l.sort(reverse=True)
>>> l
[10, 5, 4, 2]
```
---
# 4. Void and fruitful method/function 

---
**fruitful function/method**
- A function/method that returns values

**void function/method**
- A function that doesn't return values.

---

# 5. Traversing a list

---
- The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:
```python
universities = ['Rutgers', 'NYU', 'Princeton']
for i in universities:
	print(i)
```

---
- We can also traverse a list through indices.
```python
universities = ['Rutgers', 'NYU', 'Princeton']
for i in range(len(universities)):
	print(universities[i])
```
---
# 6. List operations

## `+` operator
- The + operator concatenates lists:
```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> c = a + b
>>> c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
---

## `*` operator
- The * operator repeats a list a given number of times:
```python
>>> [0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```
---

## `in` operator
- The `in` operator helps find out whether an element is in a list.
```python
>>> universities = ['Rutgers', 'NYU', 'Princeton']
>>> 'Rutgers' in universities
True
>>> 'Harvard' in universities
False
```

---
# 7. Deleting elements
---

**Method 1: `.pop()`** 
- If you know the index of the element you want, you can use pop:
```python
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> x = t.pop(1)
>>> t
['a', 'c']
>>> x
'b'
```
- `pop` modifies the list and returns the element that was removed.
---
**Method 2: `del`**
- If you donâ€™t need the removed value, you can use the `del` operator:
```python
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> del t[1]
>>> t
['a', 'c']
```
- To remove more than one element, you can use del with a slice index:
```python
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> del t[1:5]
>>> t
['a', 'f']
```
---

**Method 3: `.remove()`**
- If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use remove:
```python
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> t.remove('b')
>>> t
['a', 'c']
```
- The return value from remove is None.

# 8. List operation 1: Map

Format of `map()`
```python
map(function, iterable)
```

---
## Lambda function

# 9. List operation 2: Filter

---

# 10. List comprehension

---
# 11. Practice questions

---
1. Find even numbers, using loop and `append()` method.
	- Method 1:
		- Define a list containing a list of numbers
		- Use `for` loop to traverse the elements in the list. If the element is an even number, put it into a new list using `append` method.
		- For example, given a list `[2, 3, 10, 17, 20]`, the  result is [2, 10, 20].
	- Method 2:
		- Use comprehension to finish the question.
---
2. Find prime numbers
	- Create a function which takes an integer, return `True` if the number is a prime number and return `False` otherwise.
	- Define a list containing a list of numbers
	- Use `filter` function to obtain the prime numbers in the list and print them.
		- For example, given a list `[2, 3, 10, 17, 20]`, the prime numbers are 2, 3 and 17.

---
3. Capitalize all words in a list, using `map` function.
	- Create a function which takes a string and returns capitalized string.
	- Define a list containing several words/strings.
	- Use `map` function to capitalize all words in the list.
	- For example, given a list `['Rbs', 'Rutgers']`,  the result is `['RBS', 'RUTGERS']`.
	- Use comprehension to finish the question. 

---
4. Write a function called `nested_sum` that takes a list of lists of integers and adds up the elements from all of the nested lists. For example:
```python
>>> t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> print(nested_sum(t))
21
```
